				<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>

				<p class="text-left">
					I was contracted by the Michigan chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society to produce a system
					for managing and automating a raffle for a one-of-a-kind 2015 Ford Mustang convertible.
				</p>
				<p class="text-left">
					I was responsible for implementing a system that would output properly formatted batches matching
					the specification given by their payment processing system as well as handling failed payments and
					all related automatic emails. I worked closely with the customer and their designer to ensure that
					the final product was delivered as expected.
